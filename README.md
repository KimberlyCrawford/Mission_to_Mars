# Mission_to_Mars

# Overview
A project to extract the most recently published article's title and summary from NASA news website.

## Purpose
Robin, who loves astronomy and wants to work for NASA one day, decided to use a specific method of gathering the latest data: web scraping. Using this technique, she had the ability to pull data from multiple websites, stored it in a database, then presented the collected data in a central location: a webpage.

#### Challenge: 
Deliverable 1: Scrape Full-Resolution Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 2: Update the Web App with Mars Hemisphere Images and Titles
Deliverable 3: Add Bootstrap 3 Components

# Resources

#### Websites Scraped: 
Mars NASA News Site https://redplanetscience.com
Jet Propulsion Laboratory California Institute of Technology https://galaxyfacts-mars.com/

#### Programming Software:

BeautifulSoup and Splinter was used to automate a web browser and perform a web scrape.
MongoDB was used to create a NoSQL database to store data from the web scrape.
Flask was used to create a web application to display the data from the web scrape.
Python libraries included: html5lib and lxml.
A HTML/CSS portfolio was created to showcase projects. NOTE: HTML is a coding language used for creating webpages. Itâ€™s built using specific tags and arranging them in a nested order, a bit like building blocks. Most elements have opening and closing tags, which are identical except for the forward slash that begins the closing tag. The closing tags represent the end of that HTML element.
Bootstrap components was used to polish and customize the portfolio.
